# REACH/IMPACT Initiatives Interview Exercise

Create a virtual environment with `python3 -m venv .venv`. Activate it with `source .venv/bin/activate`. Install the requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run the code with `python analysis.py`. This will produce the plots in the `plots` folder. The notebook `REACH_HR_TEST.ipynb` has my answers to the questions in the exercise. The file `REACH_HR_TEST_DATA_analyst_answers.docx` is the word document version of the notebook that I submitted to REACH/IMPACT. `REACH_HR_TEST_DATA_analyst.docx-EmbeddedFile_answers` is the excel workbook needed for one of the questions.
